## The Agent Problem: Unreliable Execution.

Standard LLM agents are fundamentally flawed for real-world tasks. They operate on fragile prompt chains, leading to unpredictable state management, hallucinated parameters, and failed tool calls. Debugging is a nightmare; reliable automation is often impossible.

**The Proxy Base Agent (PBA) is the engineered solution.** It leverages the **[Proxy Structuring Engine (PSE)](https://github.com/TheProxyCompany/proxy-structuring-engine)** ‚Äì our high-performance Hierarchical State Machine (HSM) engine ‚Äì to transform LLMs into **truly stateful, reliable execution engines.**

Forget hoping for the best. With PBA, you **program** agent behavior through a defined state graph, and PSE **guarantees** the LLM adheres to it, step-by-step.

## PBA: Engineered Reliability & Dynamic Control

PBA delivers capabilities beyond the reach of conventional agent frameworks:

*   üß† **True Stateful Execution:** Define and enforce complex workflows using an explicit HSM (Plan ‚ûî Act). PSE guarantees state consistency and prevents derailment. *(Achieves the headline promise)*
*   ‚úÖ **100% Reliable Tool Use:** Eliminate runtime errors from malformed API calls or hallucinated arguments. PSE validates tool inputs against their schemas *during generation*. *(Achieves the headline promise)*
*   ‚ö° **Dynamic Runtime Adaptation (MCP):** Integrate new tools and capabilities on-the-fly via the Model Context Protocol. PBA dynamically updates its internal HSM, allowing immediate, reliable use of new functions without restarts. *(Killer Feature)*
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Predictable Control Flow:** Move beyond prompt ambiguity. Explicitly define agent reasoning patterns and action sequences for deterministic, controllable behavior.
*   üîå **Universal LLM Compatibility:** Run sophisticated agents locally on the models you choose (open-source or custom), using your preferred backend (MLX, PyTorch supported, more coming).
*   üß© **Modular & Extensible:** Build bespoke agents by adding custom tools, defining new states, or modifying the core HSM architecture to fit your precise needs.

## How It Works: HSM-Governed Execution

PBA's reliability stems from PSE's runtime governance. The agent's core logic is an HSM defining its operational cycle:

    end

```

1.  **HSM Definition:** The agent's states (Thinking, Tool Call, etc.) and transitions are defined as a `StateMachine`. Each state itself uses a nested PSE `StateMachine` to govern its internal structure (e.g., fenced text for planning, JSON schema for tool calls).
2.  **PSE Enforcement:** During generation, PSE's `StructuringEngine` ensures:
    *   The LLM follows valid transitions within the agent's HSM.
    *   The content generated *within* each state conforms to that state's specific structure (e.g., valid JSON for `ToolCallState`).
    *   Tool call arguments precisely match the required schema.
3.  **Dynamic Updates (MCP):** When new tools are added via `add_mcp_server`, PBA rebuilds the `ToolCallState` HSM and reconfigures PSE **at runtime**. This allows the agent to instantly leverage new capabilities with the same structural guarantees.

**PBA doesn't just *ask* the LLM to be stateful and reliable; it *engineers* it through PSE's runtime HSM governance.**

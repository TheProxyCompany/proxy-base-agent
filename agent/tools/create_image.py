Image generation tool for the Proxy Base Agent.

    Generate and display an image based on a text prompt.

    This tool has a permanent pixel art style (16x16 resolution, 8-bit aesthetic)
    to create quick, stylized visualizations. The generated image is saved to a
    temporary file and displayed to the user.

    The prompt should reflect your (the agent's) visual interpretation of the scene
    or concept. Consider incorporating artistic elements such as:
    - Artistic movements (surrealism, impressionism, art nouveau)
    - Visual styles (anime, pixel art, watercolor, oil painting)
    - Compositional elements (perspective, lighting, color palette)

    Arguments:
        prompt: Descriptive text that will be used to generate the image.
            The prompt will automatically be enhanced with pixel art modifiers.
        steps: Number of diffusion steps for image generation.
            Each step takes ~30 seconds. More steps = higher quality.
            Default: 4 steps (â‰ˆ 120 seconds)
        guidance: Controls how closely the image follows the prompt.
            Higher values (>7) = more literal interpretation but less creative variety
            Lower values (<7) = more creative but may diverge from prompt
            Default: 8.0
